We’ve developed an extension for Chrome called “Open Links in Tabs”.  Hopefully the cryptic name doesn’t disguise what this extension does!

We’re big fans of [Google’s Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/). Its our go-to choice when surfing the web or developing sites for our customers.

One of the things that makes Chrome interesting is the fact that it is extensible; you can add on to the functionality with your own custom code.  These add-on’s are called extensions.


Open Links in Tabs does just what the name says.  Click the icon to activate the extension.  In the form that pops up, type or paste in as many URLs as you like.  Each one will be opened in a new tab.
